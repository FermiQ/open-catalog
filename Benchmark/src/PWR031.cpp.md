# PWR031.cpp

## Overview

This file defines benchmarks for `PWR031`, which focuses on a numerical integration problem using the midpoint rule for the function `x^1.5 * sin(x)`. It benchmarks C and Fortran implementations of an "example" version and an "improved" (solution) version of this calculation.

## Key Components

*   **`midpoint_rule_x_pow_1_5_sin_x(a, b, n)`:** (Extern "C") A C function (defined elsewhere) representing the original version of the midpoint rule calculation.
*   **`midpoint_rule_x_pow_1_5_sin_x_improved(a, b, n)`:** (Extern "C") A C function (defined elsewhere) representing the improved/optimized version of the midpoint rule calculation.
*   **`midpoint_rule_x_pow_1_5_sin_x_f(a, b, n)`:** (Extern "C") A Fortran function (defined elsewhere) representing the original Fortran version of the midpoint rule calculation.
*   **`midpoint_rule_x_pow_1_5_sin_x_improved_f(a, b, n)`:** (Extern "C") A Fortran function (defined elsewhere) representing the improved/optimized Fortran version of the midpoint rule calculation.
*   **`CExampleBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `midpoint_rule_x_pow_1_5_sin_x` C function.
*   **`CImprovedBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `midpoint_rule_x_pow_1_5_sin_x_improved` C function.
*   **`FortranExampleBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `midpoint_rule_x_pow_1_5_sin_x_f` Fortran function.
*   **`FortranImprovedBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `midpoint_rule_x_pow_1_5_sin_x_improved_f` Fortran function.

## Important Variables/Constants

*   **`a` (constexpr double):** The lower bound of the integration interval, set to `20.0`.
*   **`b` (constexpr double):** The upper bound of the integration interval, set to `30.0`.
*   **`n` (constexpr int):** The number of subintervals for the midpoint rule, set to `524288`. This size is chosen to ensure benchmarks run for a duration measurable in microseconds.
*   **`OCB_ENABLE_C` (preprocessor macro):** If defined and true, the C benchmarks (`CExampleBench`, `CImprovedBench`) are compiled and registered.
*   **`OCB_ENABLE_Fortran` (preprocessor macro):** If defined and true, the Fortran benchmarks (`FortranExampleBench`, `FortranImprovedBench`) are compiled and registered.

## Usage Examples

This file is compiled as part of the benchmark executable. The benchmarks are automatically registered and run by the Google Benchmark framework.

```cpp
// Benchmarks are registered like this:
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR031 C Example", CExampleBench);
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR031 C Improved", CImprovedBench);
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR031 Fortran Example", FortranExampleBench);
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR031 Fortran Improved", FortranImprovedBench);

// The benchmarked functions (defined externally) are used as follows:
// double result_example = midpoint_rule_x_pow_1_5_sin_x(a, b, n);
// double result_improved = midpoint_rule_x_pow_1_5_sin_x_improved(a, b, n);
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

*   **`Benchmark.h`:** Includes the `OC_BENCHMARK` macro and potentially other utilities (though not directly used for data generation in this specific file).
*   **Google Benchmark library (`benchmark/benchmark.h` via `Benchmark.h`):** Provides the core framework for defining and running benchmarks.
*   **External C/Fortran code:** The actual numerical integration functions (`midpoint_rule_x_pow_1_5_sin_x`, etc.) are defined in other source files and linked.
*   Conditional compilation based on `OCB_ENABLE_C` and `OCB_ENABLE_Fortran` macros allows selective testing.
