# PWR039.cpp

## Overview

This file defines benchmarks for `PWR039`, which focuses on matrix multiplication (`C = A * B`). It benchmarks C and Fortran implementations of an "example" version and an "improved" (solution) version of this common linear algebra operation.

## Key Components

*   **`matmul(n, A, B, C)`:** (Extern "C") A C function (defined elsewhere) representing the original version of the matrix multiplication.
*   **`matmul_improved(n, A, B, C)`:** (Extern "C") A C function (defined elsewhere) representing the improved/optimized version of the matrix multiplication.
*   **`matmul_f(n, A, B, C)`:** (Extern "C") A Fortran function (defined elsewhere) representing the original Fortran version of the matrix multiplication.
*   **`matmul_improved_f(n, A, B, C)`:** (Extern "C") A Fortran function (defined elsewhere) representing the improved/optimized Fortran version of the matrix multiplication.
*   **`CExampleBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `matmul` C function.
*   **`CImprovedBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `matmul_improved` C function.
*   **`FortranExampleBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `matmul_f` Fortran function.
*   **`FortranImprovedBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `matmul_improved_f` Fortran function.

## Important Variables/Constants

*   **`N` (constexpr int):** Defines the dimension of the square matrices (N x N), set to `128`. The total number of elements in each matrix is `N * N`.
*   **`OCB_ENABLE_C` (preprocessor macro):** If defined and true, the C benchmarks (`CExampleBench`, `CImprovedBench`) are compiled and registered.
*   **`OCB_ENABLE_Fortran` (preprocessor macro):** If defined and true, the Fortran benchmarks (`FortranExampleBench`, `FortranImprovedBench`) are compiled and registered.

## Usage Examples

This file is compiled as part of the benchmark executable. The benchmarks are automatically registered and run by the Google Benchmark framework.

```cpp
// Benchmarks are registered like this:
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR039 C Example", CExampleBench);
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR039 C Improved", CImprovedBench);
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR039 Fortran Example", FortranExampleBench);
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR039 Fortran Improved", FortranImprovedBench);

// The benchmarked functions (defined externally) are used as follows:
// const double *A, *B; // initialized input matrices
// double *C; // zero-initialized output matrix
// matmul(N, A, B, C); // example matrix multiplication
// matmul_improved(N, A, B, C); // improved matrix multiplication
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

*   **`Benchmark.h`:** Includes utility functions like `OpenCatalog::CreateRandomVector`, `OpenCatalog::CreateZeroVector`, and the `OC_BENCHMARK` macro.
*   **Google Benchmark library (`benchmark/benchmark.h` via `Benchmark.h`):** Provides the core framework for defining and running benchmarks.
*   **External C/Fortran code:** The actual matrix multiplication functions (`matmul`, `matmul_improved`, etc.) are defined in other source files and linked.
*   Conditional compilation based on `OCB_ENABLE_C` and `OCB_ENABLE_Fortran` macros allows selective testing.
