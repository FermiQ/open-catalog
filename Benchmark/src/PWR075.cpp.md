# PWR075.cpp

## Overview

This file defines benchmarks for `PWR075`, which involves calculating distances based on two sets of points (P1, P2, likely angles or coordinates) and a corresponding set of radiuses. It benchmarks only Fortran implementations: an "example" version and an "improved" version. The objective is to demonstrate that a suggested code modernization in the "improved" version maintains performance.

## Key Components

*   **`calculate_distances_f(n, P1, P2, radiuses, distances)`:** (Extern "C") A Fortran function (defined elsewhere) representing the original version of the distance calculation.
*   **`calculate_distances_improved_f(n, P1, P2, radiuses, distances)`:** (Extern "C") A Fortran function (defined elsewhere) representing the improved/modernized version of the distance calculation.
*   **`FortranExampleBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `calculate_distances_f` Fortran function.
*   **`FortranImprovedBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `calculate_distances_improved_f` Fortran function.

## Important Variables/Constants

*   **`N` (constexpr int):** Defines the size of the input arrays `P1`, `P2`, `radiuses`, and the output array `distances`. Set to `1024 * 64`.
*   **`OCB_ENABLE_Fortran` (preprocessor macro):** If defined and true, the Fortran benchmarks (`FortranExampleBench`, `FortranImprovedBench`) are compiled and registered. (Note: C benchmarks are not present in this file).
*   Input arrays `P1` and `P2` are populated with random numbers between 0.0 and 360.0, suggesting they might represent angles.

## Usage Examples

This file is compiled as part of the benchmark executable. The benchmarks are automatically registered and run by the Google Benchmark framework.

```cpp
// Benchmarks are registered like this:
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR075 Fortran Example", FortranExampleBench);
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR075 Fortran Improved", FortranImprovedBench);

// The benchmarked functions (defined externally) are used as follows:
// double *P1, *P2, *radiuses; // initialized input arrays
// double *distances; // zero-initialized output array
// calculate_distances_f(N, P1, P2, radiuses, distances);
// calculate_distances_improved_f(N, P1, P2, radiuses, distances);
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

*   **`Benchmark.h`:** Includes utility functions like `OpenCatalog::CreateRandomVector`, `OpenCatalog::CreateZeroVector`, and the `OC_BENCHMARK` macro.
*   **Google Benchmark library (`benchmark/benchmark.h` via `Benchmark.h`):** Provides the core framework for defining and running benchmarks.
*   **External Fortran code:** The actual distance calculation functions are defined in other source files and linked.
*   Conditional compilation based on `OCB_ENABLE_Fortran` macro allows selective testing of Fortran versions. No C counterparts are benchmarked in this file.
