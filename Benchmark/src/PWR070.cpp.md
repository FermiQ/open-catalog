# PWR070.cpp

## Overview

This file defines benchmarks for `PWR070`, which deals with clamping data points at even indices within an array `X` to a specified minimum (`min_value`) and maximum (`max_value`). It benchmarks only Fortran implementations: an "example" version and an "improved" version of this operation.

## Key Components

*   **`clamp_even_data_points_f(n, X, min_value, max_value)`:** (Extern "C") A Fortran function (defined elsewhere) representing the original version of the clamping operation.
*   **`clamp_even_data_points_improved_f(n, X, min_value, max_value)`:** (Extern "C") A Fortran function (defined elsewhere) representing the improved/optimized version of the clamping operation.
*   **`FortranExampleBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `clamp_even_data_points_f` Fortran function.
*   **`FortranImprovedBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `clamp_even_data_points_improved_f` Fortran function.

## Important Variables/Constants

*   **`N` (constexpr int):** Defines the size of the input array `X`, set to `1024 * 1024`.
*   **`MIN_VALUE` (constexpr double):** The minimum value to which data points are clamped, set to `2.71`.
*   **`MAX_VALUE` (constexpr double):** The maximum value to which data points are clamped, set to `3.14`.
*   **`OCB_ENABLE_Fortran` (preprocessor macro):** If defined and true, the Fortran benchmarks (`FortranExampleBench`, `FortranImprovedBench`) are compiled and registered. (Note: C benchmarks are not present in this file).

## Usage Examples

This file is compiled as part of the benchmark executable. The benchmarks are automatically registered and run by the Google Benchmark framework. The input array `X` is modified in-place.

```cpp
// Benchmarks are registered like this:
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR070 Fortran Example", FortranExampleBench);
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR070 Fortran Improved", FortranImprovedBench);

// The benchmarked functions (defined externally) are used as follows:
// double *X; // initialized input array (will be modified)
// clamp_even_data_points_f(N, X, MIN_VALUE, MAX_VALUE);
// clamp_even_data_points_improved_f(N, X, MIN_VALUE, MAX_VALUE);
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

*   **`Benchmark.h`:** Includes utility functions like `OpenCatalog::CreateRandomVector` and the `OC_BENCHMARK` macro.
*   **Google Benchmark library (`benchmark/benchmark.h` via `Benchmark.h`):** Provides the core framework for defining and running benchmarks.
*   **External Fortran code:** The actual clamping functions are defined in other source files and linked.
*   Conditional compilation based on `OCB_ENABLE_Fortran` macro allows selective testing of Fortran versions. No C counterparts are benchmarked in this file.
