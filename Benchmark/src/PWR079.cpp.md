# PWR079.cpp

## Overview

This file defines benchmarks for `PWR079`, which focuses on summing all elements in a given array. It benchmarks C and Fortran implementations of an "example" version and an "improved" (solution) version of this summation. The objective is to show that a suggested check or optimization in the "improved" version does not lead to performance degradation.

## Key Components

*   **`sum_array(n, array)`:** (Extern "C") A C function (defined elsewhere) representing the original version of the array summation. Returns the sum as a `double`.
*   **`sum_array_improved(n, array)`:** (Extern "C") A C function (defined elsewhere) representing the improved/optimized version of the array summation. Returns the sum as a `double`.
*   **`sum_array_f(n, array)`:** (Extern "C") A Fortran function (defined elsewhere) representing the original Fortran version of the array summation. Returns the sum as a `double`.
*   **`sum_array_improved_f(n, array)`:** (Extern "C") A Fortran function (defined elsewhere) representing the improved/optimized Fortran version of the array summation. Returns the sum as a `double`.
*   **`CExampleBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `sum_array` C function.
*   **`CImprovedBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `sum_array_improved` C function.
*   **`FortranExampleBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `sum_array_f` Fortran function.
*   **`FortranImprovedBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `sum_array_improved_f` Fortran function.

## Important Variables/Constants

*   **`N` (constexpr int):** Defines the size of the input `array`, set to `1024 * 1024`.
*   **`OCB_ENABLE_C` (preprocessor macro):** If defined and true, the C benchmarks (`CExampleBench`, `CImprovedBench`) are compiled and registered.
*   **`OCB_ENABLE_Fortran` (preprocessor macro):** If defined and true, the Fortran benchmarks (`FortranExampleBench`, `FortranImprovedBench`) are compiled and registered.

## Usage Examples

This file is compiled as part of the benchmark executable. The benchmarks are automatically registered and run by the Google Benchmark framework.

```cpp
// Benchmarks are registered like this:
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR079 C Example", CExampleBench);
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR079 C Improved", CImprovedBench);
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR079 Fortran Example", FortranExampleBench);
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR079 Fortran Improved", FortranImprovedBench);

// The benchmarked functions (defined externally) are used as follows:
// const double *array; // initialized input array
// double sum_c_example = sum_array(N, array);
// double sum_c_improved = sum_array_improved(N, array);
// double sum_f_example = sum_array_f(N, array);
// double sum_f_improved = sum_array_improved_f(N, array);
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

*   **`Benchmark.h`:** Includes utility functions like `OpenCatalog::CreateRandomVector` and the `OC_BENCHMARK` macro.
*   **Google Benchmark library (`benchmark/benchmark.h` via `Benchmark.h`):** Provides the core framework for defining and running benchmarks.
*   **External C/Fortran code:** The actual array summation functions are defined in other source files and linked.
*   Conditional compilation based on `OCB_ENABLE_C` and `OCB_ENABLE_Fortran` macros allows selective testing.
