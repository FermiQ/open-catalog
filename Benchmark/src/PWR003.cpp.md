# PWR003.cpp

## Overview

This file defines benchmarks for `PWR003`, which likely relates to a specific performance optimization pattern or check. It benchmarks C and Fortran implementations of an "example" version and an "improved" (solution) version of a particular computation. The computation involves calculating weights based on masses.

## Key Components

*   **`example(N, masses, weights)`:** (Extern "C") A C function (presumably defined elsewhere) representing the original version of the computation.
*   **`solution(N, masses, weights)`:** (Extern "C") A C function (presumably defined elsewhere) representing the improved/optimized version of the computation.
*   **`example_f(N, masses, weights)`:** (Extern "C") A Fortran function (presumably defined elsewhere) representing the original Fortran version of the computation.
*   **`solution_f(N, masses, weights)`:** (Extern "C") A Fortran function (presumably defined elsewhere) representing the improved/optimized Fortran version of the computation.
*   **`CExampleBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `example` C function.
*   **`CImprovedBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `solution` C function.
*   **`FortranExampleBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `example_f` Fortran function.
*   **`FortranImprovedBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `solution_f` Fortran function.

## Important Variables/Constants

*   **`N` (constexpr int):** Defines the size of the input arrays for the benchmark, set to `128 * 128 * 128`. This size is chosen to ensure benchmarks run for a duration measurable in microseconds.
*   **`OCB_ENABLE_C` (preprocessor macro):** If defined and true, the C benchmarks (`CExampleBench`, `CImprovedBench`) are compiled and registered.
*   **`OCB_ENABLE_Fortran` (preprocessor macro):** If defined and true, the Fortran benchmarks (`FortranExampleBench`, `FortranImprovedBench`) are compiled and registered.

## Usage Examples

This file is not meant to be used as a library. It's compiled as part of the benchmark executable. The benchmarks are automatically registered and run by the Google Benchmark framework.

The core logic being benchmarked (e.g., `example`, `solution` functions) is defined externally. This file sets up the data for these functions and measures their execution time.

```cpp
// Within this file, benchmarks are registered like this:
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR003 C Example", CExampleBench);
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR003 C Improved", CImprovedBench);

// The benchmarked functions `example` and `solution` would be used like:
// double *masses = ...; // initialized data
// double *weights = ...; // zeroed data
// example(N, masses, weights); // populates weights
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

*   **`Benchmark.h`:** Includes utility functions like `OpenCatalog::CreateRandomVector` and `OpenCatalog::CreateZeroVector`, and the `OC_BENCHMARK` macro.
*   **Google Benchmark library (`benchmark/benchmark.h` via `Benchmark.h`):** Provides the framework for defining and running benchmarks.
*   **External C/Fortran code:** The actual computations (`example`, `solution`, `example_f`, `solution_f`) are defined in other source files and linked. The `extern "C"` linkage specification is used to ensure name mangling compatibility between C++ and these external functions (which might be C or Fortran compiled to be C-compatible).
*   The benchmarks are conditionally compiled based on `OCB_ENABLE_C` and `OCB_ENABLE_Fortran` macros, allowing selective testing of C and Fortran versions.
