# PWR032.cpp

## Overview

This file defines benchmarks for `PWR032`, which likely involves a computation using pairs of 2D coordinates (X1,Y1) and (X2,Y2) to produce a result array. It benchmarks C implementations of an "example" version and an "improved" (solution) version of this computation. Fortran versions are not included in this specific benchmark file.

## Key Components

*   **`example(N, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, result)`:** (Extern "C") A C function (defined elsewhere) representing the original version of the computation.
*   **`solution(N, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, result)`:** (Extern "C") A C function (defined elsewhere) representing the improved/optimized version of the computation.
*   **`CExampleBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `example` C function.
*   **`CImprovedBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `solution` C function.

## Important Variables/Constants

*   **`N` (constexpr int):** Defines the size of the input arrays, set to `128 * 128 * 128`. This large size is chosen to ensure benchmarks run for a duration measurable in microseconds.
*   **`OCB_ENABLE_C` (preprocessor macro):** If defined and true, the C benchmarks (`CExampleBench`, `CImprovedBench`) are compiled and registered. (Note: Fortran benchmarks are not present in this file).

## Usage Examples

This file is compiled as part of the benchmark executable. The benchmarks are automatically registered and run by the Google Benchmark framework.

```cpp
// Benchmarks are registered like this:
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR032 C Example", CExampleBench);
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR032 C Improved", CImprovedBench);

// The benchmarked functions (defined externally) are used as follows:
// const float *X1, *Y1, *X2, *Y2; // initialized data
// float *result; // uninitialized data for output
// example(N, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, result); // example computation
// solution(N, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, result); // improved computation
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

*   **`Benchmark.h`:** Includes utility functions like `OpenCatalog::CreateRandomVector`, `OpenCatalog::CreateUninitializedVector`, and the `OC_BENCHMARK` macro.
*   **Google Benchmark library (`benchmark/benchmark.h` via `Benchmark.h`):** Provides the core framework for defining and running benchmarks.
*   **External C code:** The actual computations (`example`, `solution`) are defined in other source files and linked.
*   Conditional compilation based on `OCB_ENABLE_C` macro allows selective testing of C versions. No Fortran counterparts are benchmarked in this file.
