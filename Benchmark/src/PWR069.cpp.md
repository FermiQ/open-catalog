# PWR069.cpp

## Overview

This file defines benchmarks for `PWR069`, focusing on calculating Euclidean distances between pairs of points (X1,Y1) and (X2,Y2). It benchmarks only Fortran implementations: an "example" version and an "improved" version. Similar to `PWR068`, the goal is to demonstrate that a suggested code modernization in the "improved" version does not incur a performance penalty. This file is structurally identical to `PWR068.cpp`.

## Key Components

*   **`calculate_euclidean_distances_f(n, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, distances)`:** (Extern "C") A Fortran function (defined elsewhere) representing the original version of the Euclidean distance calculation.
*   **`calculate_euclidean_distances_improved_f(n, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, distances)`:** (Extern "C") A Fortran function (defined elsewhere) representing the improved/modernized version of the Euclidean distance calculation.
*   **`FortranExampleBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `calculate_euclidean_distances_f` Fortran function.
*   **`FortranImprovedBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `calculate_euclidean_distances_improved_f` Fortran function.

## Important Variables/Constants

*   **`N` (constexpr int):** Defines the number of points and the size of the `distances` array, set to `1024 * 1024`.
*   **`OCB_ENABLE_Fortran` (preprocessor macro):** If defined and true, the Fortran benchmarks (`FortranExampleBench`, `FortranImprovedBench`) are compiled and registered. (Note: C benchmarks are not present in this file).

## Usage Examples

This file is compiled as part of the benchmark executable. The benchmarks are automatically registered and run by the Google Benchmark framework.

```cpp
// Benchmarks are registered like this:
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR069 Fortran Example", FortranExampleBench);
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR069 Fortran Improved", FortranImprovedBench);

// The benchmarked functions (defined externally) are used as follows:
// double *X1, *Y1, *X2, *Y2; // initialized input coordinate arrays
// double *distances; // zero-initialized output array for distances
// calculate_euclidean_distances_f(N, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, distances);
// calculate_euclidean_distances_improved_f(N, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, distances);
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

*   **`Benchmark.h`:** Includes utility functions like `OpenCatalog::CreateRandomVector`, `OpenCatalog::CreateZeroVector`, and the `OC_BENCHMARK` macro.
*   **Google Benchmark library (`benchmark/benchmark.h` via `Benchmark.h`):** Provides the core framework for defining and running benchmarks.
*   **External Fortran code:** The actual Euclidean distance calculation functions are defined in other source files and linked.
*   Conditional compilation based on `OCB_ENABLE_Fortran` macro allows selective testing of Fortran versions. No C counterparts are benchmarked in this file.
