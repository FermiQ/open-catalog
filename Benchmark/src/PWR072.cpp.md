# PWR072.cpp

## Overview

This file defines benchmarks for `PWR072`, which focuses on computing the final moving average of a data series `X`. It benchmarks only Fortran implementations: an "example" version and an "improved" version of this calculation. The goal is to show that a suggested code modernization in the "improved" version does not negatively impact performance.

## Key Components

*   **`compute_final_moving_average_f(n, X)`:** (Extern "C") A Fortran function (defined elsewhere) representing the original version of the moving average calculation. It returns a single `double` value.
*   **`compute_final_moving_average_improved_f(n, X)`:** (Extern "C") A Fortran function (defined elsewhere) representing the improved/modernized version of the moving average calculation. It returns a single `double` value.
*   **`FortranExampleBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `compute_final_moving_average_f` Fortran function.
*   **`FortranImprovedBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `compute_final_moving_average_improved_f` Fortran function.

## Important Variables/Constants

*   **`N` (constexpr int):** Defines the size of the input array `X`, set to `1024 * 1024`.
*   **`OCB_ENABLE_Fortran` (preprocessor macro):** If defined and true, the Fortran benchmarks (`FortranExampleBench`, `FortranImprovedBench`) are compiled and registered. (Note: C benchmarks are not present in this file).

## Usage Examples

This file is compiled as part of the benchmark executable. The benchmarks are automatically registered and run by the Google Benchmark framework. The input array `X` is passed to the function, and a single double result is returned.

```cpp
// Benchmarks are registered like this:
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR072 Fortran Example", FortranExampleBench);
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR072 Fortran Improved", FortranImprovedBench);

// The benchmarked functions (defined externally) are used as follows:
// double *X; // initialized input array
// double moving_avg_example = compute_final_moving_average_f(N, X);
// double moving_avg_improved = compute_final_moving_average_improved_f(N, X);
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

*   **`Benchmark.h`:** Includes utility functions like `OpenCatalog::CreateRandomVector` and the `OC_BENCHMARK` macro.
*   **Google Benchmark library (`benchmark/benchmark.h` via `Benchmark.h`):** Provides the core framework for defining and running benchmarks.
*   **External Fortran code:** The actual moving average calculation functions are defined in other source files and linked.
*   Conditional compilation based on `OCB_ENABLE_Fortran` macro allows selective testing of Fortran versions. No C counterparts are benchmarked in this file.
