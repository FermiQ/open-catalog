# PWR073.cpp

## Overview

This file defines benchmarks for `PWR073`, which focuses on transforming a vector `X` into a `result` vector using a linear transformation defined by coefficients `coeff_a` and `coeff_b`. It benchmarks only Fortran implementations: an "example" version and an "improved" version of this transformation. The stated goal is to show that a suggested code modernization in the "improved" version does not negatively impact performance.

## Key Components

*   **`transform_vector_f(n, X, result, coeff_a, coeff_b)`:** (Extern "C") A Fortran function (defined elsewhere) representing the original version of the vector transformation.
*   **`transform_vector_improved_f(n, X, result, coeff_a, coeff_b)`:** (Extern "C") A Fortran function (defined elsewhere) representing the improved/modernized version of the vector transformation.
*   **`FortranExampleBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `transform_vector_f` Fortran function.
*   **`FortranImprovedBench(state)`:** A benchmark function that measures the performance of the `transform_vector_improved_f` Fortran function.

## Important Variables/Constants

*   **`N` (constexpr int):** Defines the size of the input array `X` and the output array `result`, set to `1024 * 1024`.
*   **`COEFF_A` (constexpr double):** The first coefficient for the transformation, set to `4.5`.
*   **`COEFF_B` (constexpr double):** The second coefficient for the transformation, set to `0.73`.
*   **`OCB_ENABLE_Fortran` (preprocessor macro):** If defined and true, the Fortran benchmarks (`FortranExampleBench`, `FortranImprovedBench`) are compiled and registered. (Note: C benchmarks are not present in this file).

## Usage Examples

This file is compiled as part of the benchmark executable. The benchmarks are automatically registered and run by the Google Benchmark framework.

```cpp
// Benchmarks are registered like this:
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR073 Fortran Example", FortranExampleBench);
// OC_BENCHMARK("PWR073 Fortran Improved", FortranImprovedBench);

// The benchmarked functions (defined externally) are used as follows:
// double *X; // initialized input array
// double *result; // zero-initialized output array
// transform_vector_f(N, X, result, COEFF_A, COEFF_B);
// transform_vector_improved_f(N, X, result, COEFF_A, COEFF_B);
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

*   **`Benchmark.h`:** Includes utility functions like `OpenCatalog::CreateRandomVector`, `OpenCatalog::CreateZeroVector`, and the `OC_BENCHMARK` macro.
*   **Google Benchmark library (`benchmark/benchmark.h` via `Benchmark.h`):** Provides the core framework for defining and running benchmarks.
*   **External Fortran code:** The actual vector transformation functions are defined in other source files and linked.
*   Conditional compilation based on `OCB_ENABLE_Fortran` macro allows selective testing of Fortran versions. No C counterparts are benchmarked in this file.
